##Chunky Monkey
-Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

##Confirm the string
-Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).
This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

##Finders Keepers
-Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'. This means that given an element x, the 'truth test' is passed if func(x) is true. If no element passes the test, return undefined.
